Open DevTools
There are many ways to open DevTools, because different users want quick access to different parts of the DevTools UI.

To work with the DOM or CSS, right-click an element on the page and select Inspect to jump into the Elements panel. Or press Command+Option+C (Mac) or Control+Shift+C (Windows, Linux, ChromeOS).
To see logged messages or run JavaScript, press Command+Option+J (Mac) or Control+Shift+J (Windows, Linux, ChromeOS) to jump straight into the Console panel.
See Open Chrome DevTools for more details and workflows.
